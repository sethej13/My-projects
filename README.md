# Testing-and-Example-Files
Test files for random things, making sure code works, and learning new stuff.

I will be uploading projects I have created so anyone can edit them and share their new programs.

I'm interested to see what people can make out of my simple programs, and hopefully I'll learn new stuff along the way.
